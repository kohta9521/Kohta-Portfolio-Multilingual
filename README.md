- ### Why did you create this directory?  
  

I created this site because I am learning various programming languages every day and I wanted to know what kind of difference I could make if I created the same site in various languages!It is also simply a review of the language I am studying!  
  

- ### Directory Description  
  


HTML/CSS/JavaScript<br>
SASS<br>
React/TypeScript/Next.js<br>
React/Tailwind CSS<br>
Python/Django<br>
Laravel<br>

We use these languages to create in each of these languages.
Of course, not all of these languages can be used perfectly at this point, so we are working with what we can!
I will update this page frequently!
